Accounting Policies<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nGeneral<br /><br />\\nThe interim-period financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report is unaudited and, in the opinion of<br /><br />\\nmanagement, includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2013,<br /><br />\\nthe changes in the consolidated statements of shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the consolidated results of operations for the<br /><br />\\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, and consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. The results<br /><br />\\nof the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of the final results to be expected for the full year. The consolidated financial<br /><br />\\nstatements were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSEC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) for interim reporting. As permitted under<br /><br />\\nthose rules, certain notes or other financial information that are normally required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGAAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) have been<br /><br />\\ncondensed or omitted from these interim consolidated financial statements.

In addition, in accordance with certain of our petroleum contracts, we have posted letters of credit related to<br /><br />\\nperformance guarantees for our minimum work obligations. These letters of credit are cash collateralized in accounts held by us and as such are classified as<br /><br />\\nrestricted cash. Upon completion of the minimum work obligations and/or entering into the next phase of the petroleum contract, the requirement to post letters<br /><br />\\nof credit will be satisfied and the cash collateral will be released. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $24.6 million and $29.9 million,<br /><br />\\nrespectively, of long-term restricted cash used to cash collateralize performance guarantees related to our petroleum contracts.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n11<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\nInventories<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nInventories consisted of $32.3 million and $33.1 million of materials and supplies and $0.8 million and $0.2 million of hydrocarbons as of<br /><br />\\nSeptember 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.

In a letter dated May 16, 2011, the Ministry of<br /><br />\\nEnergy did not approve the PoD and requested that the WCTP Block partners take certain steps regarding notifications of discovery and commerciality; and<br /><br />\\nrequested other information. The WCTP Block partners believe the combined submission was proper and have held meetings with Ghana National Petroleum<br /><br />\\nCorporation (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGNPC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) which resolved issues relating to the PoD work program. From May 2011, the Ministry of Energy, GNPC and the WCTP Block<br /><br />\\npartners continued working to resolve other differences; however, the WCTP Petroleum Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) contains specific timelines for PoD approval and<br /><br />\\ndiscussions, which expired at the end of June 2011. On June 30, 2011, we, as Operator of the WCTP Block and on behalf of the WCTP Block partners,<br /><br />\\ndelivered a Notice of Dispute to the Ministry of Energy and GNPC as provided under the WCTP PA, which is the initial step in triggering the formal dispute<br /><br />\\nresolution process under the WCTP PA with the government of Ghana regarding approval of the Mahogany PoD. This Notice of Dispute establishes a process<br /><br />\\nfor negotiation and consultation for a period of 30 days (or longer if mutually agreed) among senior representatives from the Ministry of Energy, GNPC and the<br /><br />\\nWCTP Block partners to resolve the matter. We and the WCTP Block partners are in discussions with the Ministry of Energy and GNPC to resolve<br /><br />\\ndifferences on the PoD.<br /><br />\\nTeak-1 Discovery\\xe2\\x80\\x94Two appraisal wells have been drilled.

The LC Facility provides that we maintain cash collateral in an amount equal to at least 75% of all outstanding letters of credit under the LC<br /><br />\\nFacility, provided that during the period of any breach of certain financial covenants, the required cash collateral amount shall increase to 100%. The fees<br /><br />\\nassociated with outstanding letters of credit issued will be 0.5% per annum. The LC Facility has an availability period which expires on June 1, 2016. We<br /><br />\\nmay voluntarily cancel any commitments available under the LC Facility at any time.

Under<br /><br />\\nthe terms of the agreements, BP will acquire a non-operating interest in each of the Essaouira Offshore, Foum Assaka Offshore and Tarhazoute Offshore<br /><br />\\nblocks. BP will fund Kosmos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 share of the cost of one exploration well in each of the three blocks, subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million per well,<br /><br />\\nand pay its proportionate share of any well costs above the maximum spend. In the event a second exploration well is drilled in any block, BP will pay 150%<br /><br />\\nof its share of costs subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million per well. BP shall also pay $36.3 million for their share of past costs. Completion of the<br /><br />\\ntransactions is subject to customary closing conditions, including Moroccan Government approvals. After completing the transaction, our participating<br /><br />\\ninterests will be 30.0%, 29.925% and 30.0% in the Essaouira, Foum Assaka and Tarhazoute Offshore blocks, respectively, and we will remain the operator.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nIn October 2013, we entered into a farm-out agreement with Capricorn Exploration & Development Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of<br /><br />\\nCairn Energy PLC (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCairn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), covering the Cap Boujdour Contract Area, offshore Western Sahara. Under the terms of the agreement, Cairn will acquire a 20%<br /><br />\\nnon-operated interest in the exploration permits comprising the Cap Boujdour Contract Area. Cairn will pay 150% of its share of costs of a 3D seismic survey<br /><br />\\nand one exploration well capped at $125.0 million. In the event the exploration well is successful, Cairn will pay 200% of its share of costs on two appraisal<br /><br />\\nwells capped at $100.0 million per well. Additionally, Cairn will contribute $12.3 million towards our future costs. Completion of the transaction is subject to<br /><br />\\ncustomary closing conditions, including Moroccan Government approvals. After completing the transaction, our participating interest in the Cap Boujdour<br /><br />\\nContract Area will be 55.0% and we will remain the operator.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nDrilling of the Akasa-2A appraisal well on the WCTP Block was completed in October 2013. The Akasa-2A appraisal well did not encounter oil or<br /><br />\\ngas reserves sufficient to be utilized as a producing well. Accounting rules require that the costs associated with the Akasa-2A appraisal well be impaired,<br /><br />\\nwhich are $11.5 million and included in exploration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. We estimate we will incur an<br /><br />\\nadditional $8.9 million of related well costs, which will be expensed as incurred.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n21<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nItem 2.

Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that was completed immediately prior to the closing of Kosmos Energy Ltd.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IPO on May 16,<br /><br />\\n2011, all of the interests in Kosmos Energy Holdings were exchanged for newly issued common shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd. As a result, Kosmos Energy<br /><br />\\nHoldings became wholly owned by Kosmos Energy Ltd.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nRecent Developments<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nDebt<br /><br />\\nOur $2.0 billion commercial debt facility (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFacility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) provides a revolving-credit and letter of credit facility. The availability period for the revolvingcredit facility, as amended in April 2013, expires on December 15, 2014 and the letter of credit sublimit expires on the final maturity date. The available<br /><br />\\nfacility amount is subject to borrowing base constraints and, beginning on December 15, 2014, outstanding borrowings will also be constrained by an<br /><br />\\namortization schedule. The final maturity date is March 29, 2018.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nIn September 2013, as part of the normal borrowing base determination process, the availability under the facility was reduced $89.6 million to<br /><br />\\n$1.2 billion. As of September 30, 2013, borrowings under the Facility totaled $900.0 million, the undrawn availability under the Facility was $309.5 million<br /><br />\\nand there were no letters of credit drawn under the facility.<br /><br />\\nIn July 2013, we entered into a revolving letter of credit facility agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLC Facility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The size of the LC Facility is $100.0 million, with<br /><br />\\nadditional commitments up to $50.0 million being available if the existing lender increases its commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions<br /><br />\\nare added. The LC Facility provides that we shall maintain cash collateral in an amount equal to at least 75% of all outstanding letters of credit under the LC<br /><br />\\nFacility, provided that during the period of any breach of certain financial covenants, the required cash collateral amount shall increase to 100%. The fees<br /><br />\\nassociated with outstanding letters of credit issued will be 0.5% per annum. The LC Facility has an availability period which expires on June 1, 2016. We<br /><br />\\nmay voluntarily cancel any commitments available under the LC Facility at any time. As of September 30, 2013, there were four outstanding letters of credit<br /><br />\\ntotaling $29.0 million under the LC Facility.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nGhaha<br /><br />\\nWe previously received an approval for the Phase 1A PoD of the Jubilee Field, and production from Phase 1A commenced in late 2012. The<br /><br />\\nPhase 1A program includes the drilling of up to eight additional wells consisting of up to five production wells and three water injection wells. Four wells, three<br /><br />\\nproducers and one injector, are online. Program execution is expected to be completed in the latter part of 2014.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nDrilling of the Akasa-2A appraisal well on the WCTP Block was completed in October 2013. We believe that the well successfully identified the<br /><br />\\ndown dip water contact associated with the Akasa-1 discovery as intended. Should the Akasa discovery progress to a development, the Akasa-2A appraisal<br /><br />\\nwell is expected to be utilized in the development as a water injector well. However, since the Akasa-2A appraisal well did not encounter oil or gas reserves<br /><br />\\nsufficient to be utilized as a producing well, accounting rules require that the costs associated with the Akasa-2A appraisal well be impaired. As such, $11.5<br /><br />\\nmillion is included in exploration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,<br /><br />\\n2013. We estimate we will incur an additional $8.9 million of related well costs, which will be expensed as incurred.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n22<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nCamerooh<br /><br />\\nIn July 2013, we informed the government of Cameroon that we do not intend to enter into the next phase of our petroleum contracts in Cameroon and<br /><br />\\nexpect to relinquish our rights to the blocks.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nIrelahd<br /><br />\\nIn July 2013, Ireland granted us Frontier Exploration Licenses 1-13, 2-13, and 3-13 pursuant to Licensing Options 11/5, 11/7 and 11/8.

Oil and gas revenue increased $186.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared with the nine<br /><br />\\nmonths ended September 30, 2012. The increase is primarily due to having six liftings of oil during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to<br /><br />\\nhaving four liftings of oil during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase is partially offset by a lower realized price per barrel during the<br /><br />\\nnine months ended September 30, 2013.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nOil ahd gas productioh. Oil and gas production costs increased $7.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared with<br /><br />\\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2012. The increase is primarily due to an increase in routine operating expenses related to the increase in production<br /><br />\\nvolumes and liftings during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012. In addition, higher<br /><br />\\nworkover and rig equipment costs were incurred during 2013 as compared to 2012.<br /><br />\\nExploratioh expehses.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we incurred<br /><br />\\n$66.2 million for seismic costs for Suriname, Morocco, Ghana and Cameroon and $19.4 million of unsuccessful well costs, primarily related to the Ghana<br /><br />\\nTeak-4A appraisal well.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nGeheral ahd admihistrative. General and administrative costs increased $6.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as<br /><br />\\ncompared with the nine months ended September 30, 2012, due to an increase in headcount. Total non-cash general and administrative costs were $50.8<br /><br />\\nmillion and $58.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which was primarily related to equity-based compensation.<br /><br />\\nDepletioh ahd depreciatioh. Depletion and depreciation increased $47.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared<br /><br />\\nwith the nine months ended September 30, 2012.

We have historically met our funding requirements through cash flows generated from our operating activities<br /><br />\\nand secured funding from issuances of equity and commercial debt facilities to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nSighificaht Sources of Capital<br /><br />\\nFacility<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nIn March 2011, the Company secured a $2.0 billion commercial debt facility (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFacility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) from a number of financial institutions and<br /><br />\\nextinguished the then existing commercial debt facilities. The Facility was syndicated to certain participants of the existing facilities, as well as new<br /><br />\\nparticipants. The Facility supports our oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development programs and corporate activities. As part of an amendment in<br /><br />\\nNovember 2012, the total commitments for the Facility were reduced to $1.5 billion.<br /><br />\\nThe Facility provides a revolving-credit and letter of credit facility. The availability period for the revolving-credit facility, as amended in April 2013,<br /><br />\\nexpires on December 15, 2014 and the letter of credit sublimit expires on the final maturity date. The available facility amount is subject to borrowing base<br /><br />\\nconstraints and, beginning on December 15, 2014, outstanding borrowings will also be constrained by an amortization schedule. The final maturity date is<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nMarch 29, 2018.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nIn September 2013, as part of the normal borrowing base determination process, the availability under the facility was reduced $89.6 million to<br /><br />\\n$1.2 billion. As of September 30, 2013, borrowings under the Facility totaled $900.0 million, the undrawn availability under the Facility was $309.5 million<br /><br />\\nand there were no letters of credit drawn under the facility.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nCorporate Revolver<br /><br />\\nIn November 2012, we secured the Corporate Revolver from a number of financial institutions. In April 2013, the availability under the Corporate<br /><br />\\nRevolver was increased from $260.0 million to $300.0 million by additional commitments from existing and new financial institutions. As of September 30,<br /><br />\\n2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Corporate Revolver and the undrawn availability under the Corporate Revolver was $300.0 million.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nRevolvihg Letter of Credit Facility<br /><br />\\nIn July 2013, we entered into a revolving LC Facility. The size of the LC Facility is $100.0 million, with additional commitments up to $50.0 million<br /><br />\\nbeing available if the existing lender increases its commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions are added. The LC Facility provides that we<br /><br />\\nshall maintain cash collateral in an amount equal to at least 75% of all outstanding letters of credit under the LC Facility, provided that during the period of<br /><br />\\nany breach of certain financial covenants, the required cash collateral amount shall increase to 100%. The fees associated with outstanding letters of credit<br /><br />\\nissued will be 0.5% per annum. The LC Facility has an availability period which expires on June 1, 2016. We may voluntarily cancel any commitments<br /><br />\\navailable under the LC Facility at any time. As of September 30, 2013, there were four outstanding letters of credit totaling $29.0 million under the LC Facility.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n27<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nCapital Expehditures ahd Ihvestmehts<br /><br />\\nWe expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop our oil and natural gas prospects and as we:<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\xc2\\xb7<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\ncomplete our 2013 exploration and appraisal drilling program in our license areas;<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\xc2\\xb7<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\ndevelop our discoveries that we determine to be commercially viable;<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\xc2\\xb7<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\npurchase and analyze seismic and other geological and geophysical data to identify future prospects; and<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\xc2\\xb7<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\ninvest in additional oil and natural gas leases and licenses.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nWe have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the number of wells we plan to drill, our<br /><br />\\nparticipating interests in our prospects, the costs involved in developing or participating in the development of a prospect, the timing of third-party projects,<br /><br />\\nand the availability of suitable equipment and qualified personnel. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic,<br /><br />\\nregulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our<br /><br />\\ncontrol. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our<br /><br />\\nhydrocarbon asset acquisition, exploration, appraisal, development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may decide to<br /><br />\\nraise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain additional<br /><br />\\nbank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in<br /><br />\\nincreased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n2013 Capital Program<br /><br />\\nOur estimate for the 2013 capital program remains at $560.0 million.

Our future<br /><br />\\nfinancial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among other factors, our level of production of oil and the prices we receive from the sale of these<br /><br />\\ncommodities, the success of our exploration and appraisal drilling program, the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the<br /><br />\\nquantities of oil and natural gas discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production, and the actual cost of exploration, appraisal<br /><br />\\nand development of our oil and natural gas assets.<br /><br />\\nThe following table presents our liquidity and financial position as of September 30, 2013:<br /><br />\\nSeptember 30,<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n2013<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nCash and cash equivalents<br /><br />\\nDrawings under the Facility<br /><br />\\nNet debt<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n$<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nAvailability under the Facility<br /><br />\\nAvailability under the Corporate Revolver<br /><br />\\nAvailable borrowings plus cash and cash equivalents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n$<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n(In thousands)<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n440,267<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n900,000<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n459,733<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n309,504<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n300,000<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n1,049,771<br /><br />\\n28<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nCash Flows<br /><br />\\nNine Months Ended September 30,<br /><br />\\n2013<br /><br />\\n2012<br /><br />\\n(In thousands)<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nNet cash provided by (used in):<br /><br />\\nOperating activities<br /><br />\\nInvesting activities<br /><br />\\nFinancing activities<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n$<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n281,349<br /><br />\\n(240,950)<br /><br />\\n(115,296)<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n$<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n150,110<br /><br />\\n(304,800)<br /><br />\\n(118,752)<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nOperating activities.

The increase in cash provided by operating<br /><br />\\nactivities in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily due to an increase in oil and gas revenues<br /><br />\\noffset by a negative change in working capital items.<br /><br />\\nInvesting activities.

The decrease in cash used in investing activities in the nine<br /><br />\\nmonths ended September 30, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenditures for oil and gas assets<br /><br />\\nand the release of restricted cash during 2013.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nFinancing activities.

The interest rate on this indebtedness as of September 30, 2013 was approximately 3.4%. If LIBOR changed by 10% at this level of floating rate debt, our<br /><br />\\ncash paid for interest would increase or decrease by $0.1 million per year on the Facility. We pay commitment fees on the $309.5 million of undrawn<br /><br />\\navailability and $290.5 million of unavailable commitments under the Facility and on the $300.0 million of undrawn availability under the Corporate<br /><br />\\nRevolver, which are not subject to changes in interest rates.<br /><br />\\nAs of September 30, 2013, the fair market value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately $4.2 million. If LIBOR increased by<br /><br />\\n10%, we estimate the liability would decrease to approximately $4.1 million, and if LIBOR decreased by 10%, we estimate the liability would increase to<br /><br />\\napproximately $4.3 million.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nEvaluatioh of Disclosure Cohtrols ahd Procedures<br /><br />\\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disclosure controls<br /><br />\\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExchange Act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)) was performed under the<br /><br />\\nsupervision and with the participation of the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This evaluation<br /><br />\\nconsidered the various processes carried out under the direction of our disclosure committee in an effort to ensure that information required to be disclosed in<br /><br />\\nthe SEC reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accurate, complete and timely. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and<br /><br />\\noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system must reflect the<br /><br />\\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Consequently, no evaluation of controls can<br /><br />\\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. Based upon this evaluation, our<br /><br />\\nChief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,<br /><br />\\n2013, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,<br /><br />\\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and<br /><br />\\ncommunicated to the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding<br /><br />\\nrequired disclosure.<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nEvaluatioh of Chahges ih Ihterhal Cohtrol over Fihahcial Reportihg<br /><br />\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or<br /><br />\\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.<br /><br />\\n33<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\n\\x0cTable of Contents<br /><br />\\n<br /><br />\\nPART II.

Because the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSEC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) defines the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9caffiliate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d broadly, it<br /><br />\\nincludes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontrol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also construed broadly<br /><br />\\nby the SEC).<br /><br />\\nWe are not presently aware that we and our consolidated subsidiaries have knowingly engaged in any transaction or dealing reportable under<br /><br />\\nSection 13(r) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2013.
