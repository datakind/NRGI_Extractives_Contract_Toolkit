## Omidyar Extractive Industry Fiscal Governance
### Project 1: Perceptions and interpretation of contracts
#### We want to use SEC reports and the GDELT database to create sentiment data about extractives projects (such as riskiness, unpredictability, environmental impact, cost overruns), so that we add additional context to the disclosed project payment data, so that we can better understand the impact of extractives projects in highly corrupt countries and we can identify projects that have been associated with negative sentiment and interpret the payment data in that context.
